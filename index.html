		 <h3>A little about me </h3>
		 <p> Hello, my name is Skyler Saltos and I am a Computer Engineering student at UCR. I love working with embedded systems
			  and taking a more hands on approach to engineering. I've built various software and hardware based projects and enjoy
			  combining the two together. On my free time I enjoy water sports, playing grand strategy video games, and spending time
			  with friends and family.<p>
